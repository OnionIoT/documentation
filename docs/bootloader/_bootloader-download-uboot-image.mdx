Use a browser to navigate to http://repo.onioniot.com/omega2/bootloader/v2025.04/

The u-boot images are named according to this syntax: `onion-omega2p_u-boot-with-spl-[UBOOT-RELEASE]-[BUILD-DATE].bin`

> For example: `onion-omega2p_u-boot-with-spl-v2025.04-20250605.bin`

Download the latest available u-boot image and place it in a new, empty directory. This new directory is where you will run the TFTP server.

**The same image can be used for the Omega2 and Omega2+ variants.** The new bootloader auto-detects flash and RAM size.
