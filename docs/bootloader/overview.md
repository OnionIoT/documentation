The bootloader is the very first program an embedded device will run when it powers up. It will do basic hardware initialization and move on to load the operating system. It can also be used to customize boot behaviour, flash new versions of the firmware/operating system, and more.

A bootloader based on a **modern release of u-boot** is now available for the Omega2 family of modules. 

## Better by Miles

It provides many benefits over the much older legacy bootloader:

- Better and faster firmware flashing and recovery options
- Support available for more modern features: enhanced command line utilities, support for scripting, networking
- End-users can customize U-Boot behaviour without rebuilding
- Based on an active, maintainable, and extendable code base

## Guides

These guides cover the Omega2â€™s new U-Boot bootloader. From here on we simply call it U-Boot. 

See the guides in this section:

- [Upgrading an Omega2 module running the previous bootloader to the new U-Boot bootloader](./upgrading-old-bootloader)
- [How to activate the U-Boot command line](./activating-bootloader)
- [How to flash firmware using U-Boot and ethernet](./flashing-firmware-over-ethernet)
- [How to flash firmware using U-Boot and serial](./flashing-firmware-over-serial)

## Details about the Omega2 U-Boot Support

- Current supported u-boot version: v2025.04 
<!-- - TODO: update to use u-boot-version variable above -->
<!-- - TODO: link to u-boot/u-boot repo and omega2 support -->
- **Compiled binaries can be found at: http://repo.onioniot.com/omega2/bootloader/v2025.04/**
<!-- - TODO: update to use u-boot-version variable above -->
- Compiled u-boot fits into existing 192kB u-boot partition on the Omega2 devices
    - First boots into u-boot SPL (Secondary Program Loader) that loads a compressed version of the full U-Boot
