To start, use a browser to navigate to http://repo.onioniot.com/omega2/images/openwrt-23.05/ <!-- TODO: update with OPENWRT_VERSION variable -->

Next, you'll need to find the firmware for your device:

* Firmware for Omega2 and Omega2S starts with `onion_omega2-`
* Firmware for Omega2**+** and Omega2S**+** starts with `onion_omega2p-`.

Then, you'll want to select the **highest** OpenWRT release and the **latest** build date. This will ensure you're using the very latest available firmware.
