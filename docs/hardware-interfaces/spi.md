## Introduction

The Omega2 has a built-in hardware SPI controller allowing it to communicate with SPI-enabled peripherals. It offers 2 Chip Selects. However, the internal flash storage uses Chip Select 0, so only Chip Select 1 is free for external devices.

## Context

The **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** is a four-wire synchronous communication protocol, largely used to connect microprocessors or microcontrollers to sensors, memory, and other peripherals.

| SPI Signal | Meaning                                                       |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SCK        | System Clock                                                  |
| MOSI       | Master Out, Slave In – Data sent from the Master to the Slave |
| MISO       | Master In, Slave Out – Data sent from the Slave to the Master |
| CS/SS      | Chip Select/Slave Select                                      |

SPI is a **synchronous** data bus, meaning that one of the lines is a clock, used to synchronize the bits being sent on the data lines.

The protocol is based on the **Master-Worker** architecture.

- The Master will generate the System Clock and the Chip Select signals.
- Each worker requires its own Chip Select connection to the Master.

## Hardware

The Omega2 has one SPI interface available:

- The interface supports half-duplex transmissions and can operate in host-mode only.
- The maximum SPI clock frequency is 40 MHz.
- The flash storage occupies SPI Chip Select 0 and cannot be used; external devices can be connected to SPI Chip Select 1.
- External devices connected to the SPI bus can affect the boot sequence under certain conditions. (Refer to [special pins - SPI pins](https://documentation.onioniot.com/hardware-interfaces/special-pins#spi-pins) for details.)

:::warning

The Omega2 does not support full-duplex SPI transmissions. This is due to a hardware bug in the underlying MT7688 SoC used in the Omega2.

The SPI and CS1 pins are highlighted on the Omega2/2S diagrams below.

## Software

The Omega2 SPI interface is available at `/dev/spidev0.1`.

- `spidev0` is the Omega2's SPI bus number.
- 1 indicates the device ID, which corresponds to the worker connected to the Omega2's CS1 pin.

### Interacting with the SPI bus

The following features are available on the SPI bus.

#### Python

Onion recommends using the `python3-spidev` Python module for SPI communication.

The `python3-spidev` module provides a series of functions that implement SPI communication through the Linux device interface. It also provides an Omega2-specific `xfer3` function that implements a half-duplex write-then-read SPI transmission.

For installation and usage instructions see: [https://github.com/OnionIoT/python-spidev#python-spidev](https://github.com/OnionIoT/python-spidev#python-spidev).
