See the [Omega2S hardware design guide](https://github.com/OnionIoT/Omega2/blob/master/Documents/Omega2S%20Hardware%20Design%20Guide.pdf) for more information and recommendations on designing boards with Ethernet.

## Software

The Ethernet port can be configured to be a client or a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) host. It is set to client mode by default.

For more information on Ethernet networking, see the [Ethernet networking article](../networking/ethernet).
