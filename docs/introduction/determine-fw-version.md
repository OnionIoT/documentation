title: Determining the Firmware Version a Device is Running
---

<!-- NOTE: Ok to keep OpenWRT release numbers hard-coded in this article -->

Follow this procedure to determine the version of the firmware running on an Omega device.

## Step 1: Finding the Firmware Version

Connect to the Omega's command line, and run this command:

```shell
uci show onion
```

The output will look something like:

```shell
root@Omega-FB94:/# uci show onion
onion.onion=onion
onion.onion.version='23.05.3'
onion.onion.build='20241015'
```

<!-- TODO: update above with OPENWRT_RELEASE variable and ONION_FW_BUILDDATE variable -->

The `onion.onion.version` value is the firmware version, and the `onion.onion.build` value is the firmware build number.

In the case above the firmware version is `23.05.3` and the build is `20241015`. <!-- TODO: update with OPENWRT_RELEASE variable and ONION_FW_BUILDDATE variable -->

### Version Info in the Login Banner

:::note

This is purely informational

:::

The firmware version info is also contained in the login banner that's displayed when a user connects to the Omega's command line, both through serial and SSH:

In this case, the firmware version is `23.05.3` and the build is `20240807`. <!-- TODO: update with OPENWRT_RELEASE variable and ONION_FW_BUILDDATE variable -->

## Step 2: Identifying the Firwmare

<!-- NOTE: Ok to keep OpenWRT release numbers hard-coded in this paragraph -->

If the firmware version is a number like `23.05.3` or `22.03.2`, and the build is a `YYYYMMDD` datecode like `20240807`, then **the firmware in question is the new firmware**.

This documentation site deals with the "new" firmware.

The version number indicates which OpenWRT release the firmware is based on, and the build number indicates the date the firmware was built and released. So firmware with version `23.05.3` and build `20241015` is based on the OpenWRT 23.05.3 release and was built on October 15, 2024. <!-- TODO: update above with OPENWRT_RELEASE, ONION_FW_BUILDDATE, and ONION_FW_BUILDDATE_TEXT variables -->

### Previous Firmware

If the firmware version is a number like `0.3.4` or `0.3.1`, and the build is a 3-digit number like `255`, then the firmware in question is the previous firmware.

This documentation site does not deal with the previous firmware. Visit the [legacy documentation site](https://docs.onion.io/) for information on the previous firmware.
