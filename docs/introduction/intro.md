## What is the Omega2

The Omega2 family of modules is a platform for building IoT products, hubs, and devices. The WiFi-enabled Linux computer modules are designed to be drop-in solutions for IoT applications.

The Omega2 offers a CPU, memory, flash storage, and a WiFi radio built into a small footprint. The modules run the OpenWRT Linux operating system and are FCC and CE certified.

Both the Omega2/2+ and Omega2S/2S+ offer USB, Ethernet, MicroSD, 2 UARTs, I2C, SPI, and GPIO interfaces.

The Omega2 is designed to be the heart of a great IoT device by providing out-of-the-box features and services, such as:

- A small form factor easily embedded into any design
- Power efficiency.
- Processing, networking, and encryption capabilities.
- Programming flexibility thanks to the Linux OS.
- A lightweight web server.
- File systems, I/O control, and package management.

All of this results in a quicker time to market for your IoT device.

## What does the Omega2 documentation offer?

Our goal is to create resources that help guide users through the various stages of a project.

**Project stages:**

1. Development
2. Deployment
3. Production

By their design, Omega2 devices reduce the time it takes to get an IoT or connected device to market. Our documentation aims to help with common pitfalls and roadblocks so you can save time moving your project from conception to production.

Our corporate philosophy is to continuously improve. We value your input and feedback.
