## Adjusting the Omega's WiFi AP Network {#adjusting-omega-ap-network-using-console}

<!-- deprecated -->

> **Important Note:** As of firmware v0.2.1, **the Console was deprecated** and replaced by OnionOS, a new web-based, graphical user interface for the Omega2 family. Learn more about [OnionOS on the Onion blog](https://onion.io/2bt-onion-os/). 
> This article will remain in the documentation to serve as reference for the deprecated Console.


The `Wi-Fi AP Settings` tab in the Settings app is used to configure your Omega's Access Point WiFi network.

On this page you can change your Omega's:

* SSID
* password
* encryption type
* IP address. 

You can also enable or disable the access point with the checkbox located at the top.

| Enable AP Mode | Enables the Omega's Access Point when checked|
| AP Network (SSID) | The Omega's Access Point SSID |
| Security | The encryption type for the Omega's Access Point |
| AP Password | The password for accessing the Omega's Access Point |
| IP Address | The Omega's IP Address on the Access Point |
