<!-- deprecated -->

> **Important Note:** As of firmware v0.2.1, **the Console was deprecated** and replaced by OnionOS, a new web-based, graphical user interface for the Omega2 family. Learn more about [OnionOS on the Onion blog](https://onion.io/2bt-onion-os/). 
> This article will remain in the documentation to serve as reference for the deprecated Console.


The Onion Console is a web-based, virtual desktop that gives you access to a number of apps that allow you to interact with your Omega in a more visual way than the command-line.

<!-- TODO: explain what the console can actually let you accomplish -->
These apps can be used to configure and control your Omega and use various Expansions through your browser. All of this is conveniently hosted on your Omega and can be accessed by visiting your Omega's webpage located at `http://Omega-ABCD.local/`.

> You'll need to be on the same network as your Omega in order to access the console.
