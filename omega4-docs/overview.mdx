The Omega4 family is Onion's next Linux module line, aimed at higher performance and easier productization than the Omega2.
<!-- This page collects the updated hardware facts, an indicative block diagram, and the links you will need to start evaluating the platform with the EVB. -->

:::info Draft content
Omega4 is under active development. Use this page as a working outline and confirm final values with release notes before committing them to a design.

## Platform highlights

- RV1103B ARM Cortex-A7 SoC tuned for OpenWrt 24.09 on the Omega4 builds.
- Onboard 256 MB DDR and 256 MB SPI NAND for faster bring-up and image swaps.
- AIC8800D80 Wi-Fi/BLE combo for dual-band connectivity on-module.
- EVB with USB-C power, console access, Ethernet, and castellated/pin headers for rapid testing.

## Hardware specs

| Area | Details |
