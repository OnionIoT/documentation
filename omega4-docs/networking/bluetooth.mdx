# Bluetooth Bring-Up & Usage Guide

Omega4 includes Bluetooth 5.0 (AIC8800D80) with BLE and Classic support in central and peripheral roles. Use it for:
- BLE sensor or beacon gateways that forward data over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- Device setup/provisioning flows with a companion mobile app.
- Low-power accessories like keyboards, barcode scanners, or remote controls.

These instructions describe how to enable and exercise the built in Bluetooth controller on Omega4 devices.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Firmware & driver**  
   - Ensure the `kmod-aic8800d-sdio` kernel module is built into the image (included since FW v0.0.2).  
   - Confirm the controller enumerates as `hci0` under `/sys/class/bluetooth/`.

2. **Networking**  
   - The steps below download packages from the standard OpenWrt feeds. Make sure the Omega4 has WAN access (or mirror the packages locally).

## 2. Install User-Space Bluetooth Stack

```sh
opkg update
opkg install \
    bluez-daemon \
    bluez-utils \
    bluez-utils-extra \
    bluez-tools
```

This pulls in `bluetoothd`, CLI helpers (`bluetoothctl`, `hciconfig`, etc.), and required libraries (`dbus`, `glib2`, `libreadline`, …).

## 3. Verify the Controller

1. List controllers:
   ```sh
   ls /sys/class/bluetooth
   # Expect: hci0
   ```
2. Inspect capabilities:
   ```sh
   hciconfig -a
   ```
   Confirm `Type: Primary  Bus: SDIO`, `UP RUNNING`, and matching BD_ADDR.

If the interface shows `DOWN`, bring it up:
```sh
hciconfig hci0 up
```

## 4. Start the Bluetooth Daemon

The init script is shipped as `/etc/init.d/bluetoothd`.

```sh
/etc/init.d/bluetoothd start      # start once
/etc/init.d/bluetoothd enable     # optional: autostart on boot
```

Verify the daemon:
```sh
pgrep -af bluetoothd     # expect /usr/bin/bluetoothd -n
```

## 5. Basic Adapter Configuration

Use `bluetoothctl`:

```sh
bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# show              # confirm Powered: yes, Roles: central/peripheral
[bluetooth]# power on          # redundant if already powered
[bluetooth]# pairable on
[bluetooth]# discoverable on   # optional, makes Omega4 visible
```

To exit the shell press `Ctrl+D` or type `quit`.

## 6. Scanning & Pairing

1. Start a timed scan (no persistent shell needed):
   ```sh
   bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on
   ```
   Expected log snippet:
   ```
   Controller 88:1E:59:05:02:87 Discovering: yes
   [NEW] Device 68:27:37:52:F0:E5 [TV] Samsung 7 Series (55)
   ```

2. Pair & trust a device (example MAC):
   ```sh
   bluetoothctl
   [bluetooth]# scan on
   [bluetooth]# pair 68:27:37:52:F0:E5
   [bluetooth]# trust 68:27:37:52:F0:E5
   [bluetooth]# connect 68:27:37:52:F0:E5
   ```

3. For audio profiles (A2DP), install PulseAudio/pipewire helpers as needed. For HID devices, pairing is usually sufficient.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `hciconfig` shows `DOWN` | `hciconfig hci0 up`; inspect `dmesg | grep aic_btsdio`. |
| `bluetoothctl` lacks permissions | Ensure `bluetoothd` is running; restart via `/etc/init.d/bluetoothd restart`. |
| No devices found when scanning | Verify antennas/power, ensure `Discoverable: yes`; watch `logread -f` for SDIO errors. |
| Packages missing | Re-run `opkg update`; confirm the target feed (`targets/rockchip/cortexa7`) is reachable or mirror the `.ipk` files. |

## 8. Useful Commands Summary

```sh
# Service control
/etc/init.d/bluetoothd {start|stop|restart|enable|disable}

# Adapter status
hciconfig -a
bluetoothctl show

# Scanning
bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on

# Logs
logread -f | grep -i bluetooth
dmesg | grep -i aic_btsdio
```
